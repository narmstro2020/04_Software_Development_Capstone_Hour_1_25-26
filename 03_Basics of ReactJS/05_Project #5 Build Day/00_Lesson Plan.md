# Capstone Hour 01 – Semester 02
## Day 11 – IOR
**Project:** React-based Toggle Viewer  
**Duration:** 86 minutes  
**Protocol:** IOR (Interactive, Ownership, Resonate)

---

### 🔨 Interactive Build (50 min)

#### Objective:
Build a component that toggles visibility of content using a button. Practice:
- Event handling (`onClick`)
- Boolean state
- Conditional rendering with `&&`, `?`, and `if`

#### Requirements:
- Show/hide a block of text or image
- Use a button to toggle visibility
- Display different button text depending on state

---

### ✍️ Ownership (25 min)

**Tasks:**
- Complete the toggle viewer app
- Style with basic CSS
- Commit and push to GitHub
- Share demo with a partner

**Checklist:**
- ✅ Toggle button implemented
- ✅ Uses `useState`
- ✅ Uses conditional rendering
- ✅ Project pushed to GitHub

---

### 💬 Resonate (10 min)

**Discussion Prompts:**
- Which rendering method did you prefer: `&&`, `?`, or `if`?
- How could you reuse this toggle component elsewhere?
- What other real apps use toggling UI elements?

**Wrap-Up:**
- Events and conditions are at the heart of interactive UIs
- React makes logic-driven rendering intuitive
