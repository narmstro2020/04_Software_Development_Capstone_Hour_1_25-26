## Day 13 – IOR
**Project:** API-powered UI – Joke Fetcher or Dog Image Viewer  
**Duration:** 86 minutes  
**Protocol:** IOR (Interactive, Ownership, Resonate)

### 🔨 Interactive Build (50 min)

#### Objective:
Build a small React app that uses `useEffect` to fetch data from an external API and display it.

**Options:**
1. **Joke Fetcher**
   - Fetches a random joke from `https://official-joke-api.appspot.com/random_joke`
   - Displays setup and punchline
   - Button to fetch a new joke

2. **Dog Image Viewer**
   - Fetches an image from `https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/image/random`
   - Displays the image
   - Button to fetch another image

### 💬 Resonate (10 min)

**Discussion Prompts:**
- What was the easiest part of using `useEffect`?
- What challenges came up when fetching data?
- How could we adapt this for more complex apps?

**Wrap-Up:**
- `useEffect` is essential for working with APIs
- API calls + React state create dynamic UIs
